** Loading bar
The loading bar is toggled when a package manager is running, currently it does not show progress
properly and just endlessly cicles but I am looking into changing that soon.

** Install
To install this status bar you can use pip the python package by downloading the
repository and running:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo pip3 install -U .

After installation you can add the script to your startup app, if you need the full
path you can use *whereis*

** Dependancies
The dependancies for python should be automatically installed by pip.
